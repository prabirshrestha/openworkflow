OpenWorkflow is a TypeScript framework for building durable, resumable workflows
that can pause for seconds or months, survive crashes and deploys, and resume
exactly where they left off - all without extra servers to manage.

> OpenWorkflow is in active development and moving quickly. Check out the
> [Roadmap](#roadmap) for what’s coming next.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Node.js
- A backend storage provider:
  - PostgreSQL (recommended for production)
  - In-memory backend (for development/testing)

Support for additional backends like Redis and SQLite coming soon. See
[Roadmap](#roadmap) for details.

### 1. Install

**With PostgreSQL (recommended for production):**

```bash
npm install openworkflow @openworkflow/backend-postgres
```

**With in-memory backend (for development/testing):**

```bash
npm install openworkflow @openworkflow/backend-memory
```

### 2. Define a workflow

**With PostgreSQL:**

```ts
import { BackendPostgres } from "@openworkflow/backend-postgres";
import { OpenWorkflow } from "openworkflow";

const postgresUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL; // connection url to your db
const backend = await BackendPostgres.connect(postgresUrl);
const ow = new OpenWorkflow({ backend });

const sendWelcomeEmail = ow.defineWorkflow(
  { name: "send-welcome-email" },
  async ({ input, step }) => {
    const user = await step.run({ name: "fetch-user" }, async () => {
      return await db.users.findOne({ id: input.userId });
    });

    await step.run({ name: "send-email" }, async () => {
      return await resend.emails.send({
        from: "me@example.com",
        to: user.email,
        replyTo: "me@example.com",
        subject: "Welcome!",
        html: "<h1>Welcome to our app!</h1>",
      });
    });

    await step.run({ name: "mark-welcome-email-sent" }, async () => {
      await db.users.update(input.userId, { welcomeEmailSent: true });
    });

    return { user };
  },
);
```

**With in-memory backend:**

```ts
import { BackendMemory } from "@openworkflow/backend-memory";
import { OpenWorkflow } from "openworkflow";

const backend = BackendMemory.create();
const ow = new OpenWorkflow({ backend });

// Define workflows the same way...
const sendWelcomeEmail = ow.defineWorkflow(
  { name: "send-welcome-email" },
  async ({ input, step }) => {
    // ... workflow logic
  },
);
```

> **Note:** The in-memory backend is ideal for development, testing, and
> scenarios where clients maintain state (e.g., via HTTP SSE with JSON patches).
> All data is lost when the process exits. Use PostgreSQL for production
> workloads requiring durability.

### 3. Start a worker

Workers are background processes that execute your workflows. Start one in a
separate process or the same one as your app:

```ts
const worker = ow.newWorker();
await worker.start();
```

### 4. Run workflows from your app

Trigger workflows from your web server, API, or any application code:

```ts
// In your API route handler
app.post("/users/:id/welcome", async (req, res) => {
  // Run the workflow async and do not wait for the result
  const runHandle = await sendWelcomeEmail.run({ userId: req.params.id });
  res.json({ runId: runHandle.workflowRun.id });
});
```

That's it. Your workflow is now durable, resumable, and fault-tolerant.

## Core Concepts

### Workflows

Workflows are durable functions. They can contain multiple steps, make external
API calls, query databases, and perform complex logic. If a workflow is
interrupted (crash, deploy, server restart), it resumes from its last completed
step.

```ts
const workflow = ow.defineWorkflow(
  { name: "my-workflow" },
  async ({ input, step }) => {
    // Your workflow logic here
    return result;
  },
);
```

### Steps

Steps are the building blocks of workflows. Each step is executed exactly once
and its result is memoized. Steps let you break workflows into checkpoints.

```ts
const result = await step.run({ name: "step-name" }, async () => {
  // This function runs once. If the workflow restarts,
  // this returns the cached result instead of re-running.
  return await someAsyncWork();
});
```

**Why steps matter**: Imagine a workflow that charges a credit card, then sends
an email. Without steps, if your server crashes after charging the card, the
workflow would retry from the beginning and charge the customer twice. With
steps, the charge is memoized. The retry skips it and goes straight to sending
the email.

### Workers

Workers are long-running processes that poll your database for pending workflows
and execute them. You can run multiple workers for high availability and scale.

```ts
const worker = ow.newWorker({ concurrency: 20 });
await worker.start();

// & to shut down...
await worker.stop(); // waits for in-flight workflows to complete
```

Workers are stateless. They can be started, stopped, and deployed independently.
Your database is the source of truth.

### How it Works

1. **Your app starts a workflow**: A row is inserted into the `workflow_runs`
   table with status `pending`.
2. **A worker picks it up**: The worker polls the database, claims the workflow,
   and sets its status to `running`.
3. **The worker executes steps**: Each step is recorded in the `step_attempts`
   table. If a step succeeds, its result is cached.
4. **The workflow completes**: The worker updates the `workflow_run` status to
   `succeeded` or `failed`.
5. **If the worker crashes**: The workflow becomes visible to other workers via
   a heartbeat timeout. Another worker picks it up, loads the cached step
   results, and resumes from the next step.

## Advanced Patterns

### Parallel Steps

Run multiple steps concurrently using `Promise.all`:

```ts
const [user, subscription, settings] = await Promise.all([
  step.run({ name: "fetch-user" }, async () => {
    await db.users.findOne({ id: input.userId });
  }),
  step.run({ name: "fetch-subscription" }, async () => {
    await stripe.subscriptions.retrieve(input.subId);
  }),
  step.run({ name: "fetch-settings" }, async () => {
    await db.settings.findOne({ userId: input.userId });
  }),
]);
```

Each step is still memoized individually. If the workflow crashes mid-execution,
completed steps return instantly on resume.

### Automatic Retries

Steps can retry automatically with exponential backoff:

```ts
const data = await step.run({ name: "fetch-external-api" }, async () => {
  // If this throws, the step retries automatically
  return await externalAPI.getData();
});
```

Configure retry behavior at the workflow or step level (coming soon) or handle
errors explicitly in your step functions.

### Sleeping (Pausing) Workflows

You can pause a workflow until a future time and, because sleeping releases the
worker slot, you can pause thousands of workflows without tying up compute:

```ts
// Pause for 1 hour (durable, non-blocking)
await step.sleep("wait-one-hour", "1h");
```

The sleep step is memoized after it completes. If the workflow is replayed again
(e.g. due to a later retry) the completed sleep is not re-applied.

#### Duration Formats

Durations accept a number followed by a unit:

| Unit         | Aliases               | Examples         |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| milliseconds | `ms`, `msec`, `msecs` | `100ms`, `1.5ms` |
| seconds      | `s`, `sec`, `secs`    | `5s`, `0.25s`    |
| minutes      | `m`, `min`, `mins`    | `2m`, `1.5m`     |
| hours        | `h`, `hr`, `hrs`      | `1h`, `0.25h`    |
| days         | `d`, `day(s)`         | `1d`, `0.5d`     |
| weeks        | `w`, `week(s)`        | `1w`, `2w`       |
| months       | `mo`, `month(s)`      | `1mo`, `2mo`     |
| years        | `y`, `yr`, `yrs`      | `1y`, `2yr`      |

See more examples of accepted duration formats and aliases in the
[tests](https://github.com/openworkflowdev/openworkflow/blob/main/packages/openworkflow/duration.test.ts).

### Type Safety

Workflows are fully typed. Define input and output types for compile-time
safety:

```ts
interface ProcessOrderInput {
  orderId: string;
  userId: string;
}

interface ProcessOrderOutput {
  paymentId: string;
  shipmentId: string;
}

const processOrder = ow.defineWorkflow<ProcessOrderInput, ProcessOrderOutput>(
  { name: "process-order" },
  async ({ input, step }) => {
    // input is typed as ProcessOrderInput
    // return type must match ProcessOrderOutput
    return { paymentId: "...", shipmentId: "..." };
  },
);
```

### Waiting for Results

You can wait for a workflow to complete and get its result:

```ts
const run = await myWorkflow.run({ data: "..." });

// Wait for the workflow to finish (polls the database)
const result = await run.result();
```

### Canceling Workflows

You can cancel a workflow that is pending, running, or sleeping to prevent a
workflow from continuing on to the next step:

```ts
const handle = await myWorkflow.run({ data: "..." });

// Cancel the workflow
await handle.cancel();
```

### Workflow Versioning

When you need to change workflow logic, use versioning for backwards
compatibility.

Define a workflow with an optional version:

```ts
const workflow = ow.defineWorkflow(
  { name: "my-workflow", version: "v2" },
  async ({ input, step, version }) => {
    if (version === "v2") {
      // v2 runs go here
      await step.run({ name: "new-step" }, async () => {
        // legacy logic
      });
    } else {
      // v1 runs go here
      await step.run({ name: "old-step" }, async () => {
        // ...
      });
    }
  },
);
```

## Production Checklist

- **Database**: Use a production-ready Postgres instance
- **Workers**: Run at lease one worker process
- **Concurrency**: Start with `concurrency: 10` per worker and tune based on
  your workload
- **Monitoring**: Log worker activity and set up alerts for failed workflows
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handle `SIGTERM` to ensure clean deploys:
  ```ts
  process.on("SIGTERM", async () => {
    await worker.stop();
    process.exit(0);
  });
  ```
- **Namespaces** (optional): Use `namespaceId` in your backend configuration to
  isolate workflows per environment:
  ```ts
  const backend = await BackendPostgres.connect(postgresUrl, {
    namespaceId: "production",
  });
  ```
